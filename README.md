This work describes the death tolls of various disasters during the 20th and 21st centuries. 
As we can see from the plot, disasters have happened frequently throughout the years.
While at one time floods caused one of the highest death tolls, it should be noted that earthquakes are often the leading ones causing fatalities.
Both topical cyclones and earthquakes seem to be the most frequent and deadly disasters during the studied period.
